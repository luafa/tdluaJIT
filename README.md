# TdluaJIT
Pure lua TD wrapper using LuaJIT

## semi-async update loop
**EXPERIMENTAL**

## usage
tdlua.lua is the main script
it has *almost* the same functions of [tdlua](https://github.com/giuseppeM99/tdlua) but in a pure LuaJIT fashion
this means that you just need to `require 'tdlua'` to use it.
also replace your name of lib.so in line 326
